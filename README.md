Evolve is a game by [pmotschmann](https://github.com/pmotschmann/Evolve) and is playable at https://pmotschmann.github.io/Evolve/

This save editor can currently do these things:
   * Adjust prestige currencies (Plasmids, Phages, and Dark)
   * Fill resources to maximum (or a big number for resources without a max)
   * Update resources' assigned containers and crates (when Freight Yard and/or Container Port are built)
   * Adjust building counts (but won't add the first building of its kind as that breaks things)
   * Update number of citizens to maximum supported by housing buildings
   * Update number of soldiers to maximum supported by barracks buildings and heals all troops.
   * Adjust A.R.P.A. research projects to 99% complete
   * Update genetic sequencing to 5 seconds from completion
