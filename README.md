Evolve is a game by [pmotschmann](https://github.com/pmotschmann/Evolve) and is playable at https://pmotschmann.github.io/Evolve/

This save editor can currently do these things:
   * Adjust Prestige Currencies (Plasmids, Phages, and Dark)
   * Fill Resources to Maximum (or a big number for resources without a max)
   * Adjust Building Counts (but won't add the first building of its kind as that breaks things)
   * Adjust A.R.P.A. research projects to 99% complete
   * Update genetic sequencing to 5 seconds from completion
